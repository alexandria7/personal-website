        out of Seattle, WA (although I'm originally from San Francisco, CA). While I got my degree 
        in microbiology, I later discovered I enjoyed coding and in 2019 completed Ada Developers Academy,
        a year-long program that teaches women and gender-diverse folks to become software developers. When
        I started my first full-time role at Convoy Inc, I discovered I loved building products that not
        only helped customers but excited them too.`

        frontend skills in my next role. I am also passionate about mentorship and building a great work 
        culture.`
